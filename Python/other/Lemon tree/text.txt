Lemon Tree
I'm sitting here in a boring room,
it's just another rainy Sunday afternoon.
I'm wasting my time, I got nothing to do.
I'm hanging around, I'm waiting for you,
but nothing ever happens - and I wonder.
 
I'm driving around in my car,
I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far.
I'd like to change my point of view.
I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you,
but nothing ever happens - and I wonder.
 
I wonder how, I wonder why
yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
and all that I can see
is just a yellow lemon tree.
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around.
And all that I can see
is just another lemon tree.
 
Sing: dah...
 
I'm sitting here, I miss the power,
I'd like to go out, taking a shower,
but there's a heavy cloud inside my head.
I feel so tired, put myself into bed,
where nothing ever happens - and I wonder.
 
Isolation - is not the good for me.
Isolation - I don't want to sit on a lemon tree.
I'm steppin' around in a desert of joy.
Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
and everything will happen - and you'll wonder.
 
I wonder how, I wonder why
yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
and all that I can see
is just another lemon tree.
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning, turning, turning, turning, turning around
and all that I can see
is just a yellow lemon tree.
 
And I wonder, wonder
I wonder how, I wonder why
yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
and all that I can see
and all that I can see
and all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree.
